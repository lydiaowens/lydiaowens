## About Me

Hello! My name is Lydia Owens, and I am an aspiring public health professional passionate about biostatistics and epidemiology. 

As a biostatistics student at UNC and a student researcher at Duke, I've completed multiple projects related to infectious disease modeling, agent-based modeling, COVID-19, HIV, justice-involved population research, and health interventions.

My current work as a student researcher at the University of Oxford focuses on Bayesian spatio-temporal models for infectious disease mapping. I'm also running a research/travel blog where I share my experiences and insights.

### 🌱 Interests & Learning Goals

- **Coding:** R, Python (learning NumPyro)
- **Topics:** Mathematical modeling, causal inference, Bayesian methodologies, time series analysis, global health, health policy
- **Always eager to:** Build my skills in biostatistics, computational science, and create socially-minded change
